# Bob Fights! - C.S. (DEMO)

## 📌 Course: Game Development  
This project was completed during my senior year as part of my **Game Development** coursework.

## 🎮 Project Description  
**Bob Fights! - C.S. (DEMO)** is a combat system inspired by *Undertale*, designed as part of a larger game project. Bob, a rare encounter, challenges players as they traverse the game's world. The mechanics emphasize strategic engagement and dynamic player interactions, offering an exciting gameplay experience.

## 🔍 Why This Project?  
I chose this project because it was my **first real step into game development**. Through this experience, I explored:
- **Character Design** – Creating distinct personalities and visuals for in-game encounters.
- **Player Mechanics** – Designing movement and interaction systems for an engaging experience.
- **Gameplay Systems** – Building combat mechanics with unique enemy behavior.
- **JavaScript Coding** – Learning to implement features efficiently within the game engine.
